The Free and Open Source software movement needs to make a strategic shift in how they think
and talk about project governance.  The shift will result in a greater appreciation for the movement
and increase the promotion of their software.  Most people view the Free and Open Source software
movement as mainly concerned with development of software and licenses. However, in
addition maintaining source code and licenses, they are innovators of 'free and open project governance'.

The purpose of 'free and open project governance' is to manage 'specialized knowledge'.
Efficient management of specialized knowledge is the primary means to lower costs and compete
with established competitors. However, organizations across multiple different industries struggle
with the task of managing 'specialized knowledge'. So, the audience to benefit from a
better understanding of 'free and open project governance' is very large and cross disciplinary.

Despite organizations in the Free and Open Source software movement creating new methods
to manage 'specialized knowledge', the movement seems to take their pioneer work for granted. For example, developers
inside the movement may not be able to articulate the innovations. Taking 'free and open project governance' 
for granted results in the principles of governance not being shared with outsiders. There are a few elite organizations 
like Google utilizing 'free and open project governance' to develop new products which become quite dominant.  But, in contrast 
to Google, most organizations do not understand how to make the Free and Open Source software or 'free and open project governance' 
benefit their organization. 

Organizational leaders misunderstanding Free and Open Source software damages it's promotion and minimizes
it's benefits to society. To help organizational leaders understand the benefits of Free and Open Source software, 
the subject of 'free and open project governance' should be utilized.  Additionally, Peter Drucker's framework regarding the 
'knowledge society' should be used as the starting point to discuss 'free and open knowledge management'. His framework 
provides a vocabulary those outside the movement can understand. 

Peter Drucker was a prolific author and management expert.  His writings are still very
influential and organizational leaders respect him much.  Google executives Schmidt and Rosenberg
in their book "How Google Works" call Drucker a "management guru" (source1).

Drucker introduced the term 'knowledge society' to define social and technological changes
impacting organizations and their management of 'specialized knowledge' (source2).  Many
'knowledge society' characteristics which Drucker wrote about are found in the Free and Open Source
software movement.  This makes Drucker's 'knowledge society' framework a great starting point to
introduce the contributions being made to manage 'specialized knowledge'.

Non-software business leaders are already familiar with Drucker and highly respect him.
So, using his 'knowledge society' framework as a starting point will: 1) cause the
non-software business community to appreciate the innovations occurring within the Free and
Open Source software movement.  The promotion of 'free and open project governance' will result 
in the promotion of free and open software.  2) allow the Free software movement to develop a new appreciation
for their own contributions. 3) cause an influx of new corporate leadership interest in Free software
and 'free and open project governance'.  4) cause new interest among management experts to research
the Free and Open Source software movement for 'specialized knowledge' management insights.
5) spur business, education, and public sector leaders to consider 'free and open project governance'
as a means to maintain their 'specialized knowledge'.

In the future, plan to add the following chapters.
First, a chapter will look at Drucker's concept of the 'knowledge society' and the challenges
of managing 'specialized knowledge'.  Second, we look at 'free and open project governance' as a
means to manage 'specialized knowledge' or software.  Exciting new methods to make 'specialized knowledge'
productive have been created by the Free and Open Source software movement.  Third, we consider
some cross disciplinary applications for 'free and open project governance'.  Fourth, we discuss
next steps for 'knowledge management' research.

Note: Below is a quote from Peter Drucker in the preface:
"Which of Peter Drucker's books should I read?" Where in your work do I find the best discussion
on how to place people? Not a week goes by without by receiving half a dozen questions like these.
With thirty four books published over sixty five years, even I find it difficult to answer these
questions.
 'The Daily Drucker' is intended to provide an answer. It presents in organized form--and directly
from my own writings--a key statement of mine, followed by a few lines, also from my own works, of
comment and explanation, on topics ranging across a great many fields of my work: management,
business, and the world economy; a changing society; innovation and entrepreneurship; decision
making; the changing workforce; the nonprofits and their management; and so on.
