# ARTICLE INTRO 

The main premise is: the Free and Open Source Software movement contains many characteristics 
described by management guru Peter Drucker as elements of the 'knowledge society'. Drucker would define 
these elements as part of the 'networked society' and 'society of organizations'.  Projects like Linux, 
nodejs, and The Linux Foundation are examples of organizations networking together to manage and apply what 
Drucker would call 'specialized knowledge'.

I suggest The Free and Open Source Software movement should view themselves as pioneers in
managing 'free and open networked knowledge'.  Plus, they should utilize Peter Drucker's
'knowledge society' framework to talk about themselves. Using Drucker's framework
would give fresh perspective on the movement.  Plus, it would allow outsiders to appreciate 
the movement better. This would result in the promotion of Free and Open Source software.
